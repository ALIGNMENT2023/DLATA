# DLATA: Deep Learning-Assisted Transformation Alignment

Deep Learning-Assisted Transformation Alignment (DLATA) uses deep learning to automatically identify feature points in images after training on a few labeled samples. Following feature point recognition, the geometrical transformation technique is used for image registration. DLATA can be applied to not only the alignment of 2D brain slice, but also the one of other biological tissue slices. 

The code will be uploaded after the relevant paper is published.
